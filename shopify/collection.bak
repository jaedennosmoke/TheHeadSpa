$theme_collection_template_path = get_stylesheet_directory() . '/shopify/collection.php';
if (file_exists($theme_collection_template_path)) {
    include $theme_collection_template_path;
    return;  // ← STOPS HERE
}
```

It finds that **empty 0-byte file**, includes nothing, returns, and the block outputs zero HTML. That empty file was probably created accidentally when you set up the child theme's `shopify/` folder for the product card override.

**The fix:** Either delete that empty `collection.php` or rename it. Via SFTP, go to:
```
wp-content/themes/the-head-spa/shopify/
